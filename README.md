# Hand Gesture Recognition Project
This project focuses on the recognition of hand gestures using three different machine learning models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. The dataset used for this project is the LeapGestRecog dataset
# Overview
The goal of this project is to classify different hand gestures captured in grayscale images. Three machine learning models have been implemented and evaluated for this purpose:

Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the LeapGestRecog dataset. It contains images of hand gestures organized into different folders. Each folder represents a unique hand gesture.
# Data Source
The LeapGestRecog dataset can be accessed from the following link:
